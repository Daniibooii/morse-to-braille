# morse-to-braille

# Project Description
This is a personal project, which is still in development. Eventually, it will be available here,<br>
but also hosted online at: morsetobraille.com<br>
The site will translate Morse code into Braile.<br>
The utility of the project is limited, but it will serve to showcase my grasp of design elements,<br>
and ability to write high-quality - ie clear and concise - code with Javascrip and JQuery.<br>

# Notes
