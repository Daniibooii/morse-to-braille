# morse-to-braille

2/26/2018:<br>
Github repos dealing with Morse Code and Braille were reviewed, and the two most relevant were pulled.<br>
All credit for any base code used will be given in final documentation.<br>

The above-cited github repos are:<br>
https://github.com/liblouis/liblouis<br>
https://github.com/ecto/morse<br>

This is a personal project, which is still in development. Eventually, it will be available here,
but also hosted online at: morsetobraille.com

The site will translate Morse code into Braile.
The utility of the project is limited, but it will serve to showcase my grasp of design elements, and ability to write high-quality - ie clear and concise - code with Javascrip and JQuery.
