# morse-to-braille

This is a personal project, which is still in development. Eventually, it will be available here,
but also hosted online at: morsetobraille.com

The site will translate Morse code into Braile.
The utility of the project is limited, but it will serve to showcase my grasp of design elements, and ability to write high-quality - ie clear and concise code for Javascrip and JQuery.
